# PAYROLL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Payroll is used by organizations and companies to perform day to day staff management roles. The primary function of payroll is to assist a company in timely payment of staff wages and salaries. 

The employee is credited by his/ her salary through his/her account by including taxes and even keeping track of the departments to which he/she belong and their projects. We try to calculate the leaves taken by the employee so that he/she can get paid according to their leaves and attendance.
